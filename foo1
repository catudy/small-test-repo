To explain long division to a 4-year-old, let's think of it as sharing!

Imagine you have 10 cookies and you want to share them with 2 friends equally. 

1. **Count the Cookies**: First, let's count how many cookies we have. We have 10 cookies.

2. **Sharing the Cookies**: Now, we need to share them with 2 friends. 

3. **One at a Time**: We can give one cookie to each friend, one at a time. 

4. **Repeat**: We keep going until we have no cookies left to share. 

5. **Count How Many Each Gets**: After sharing, we count the cookies each friend got. 

So, each friend gets 5 cookies! 

In long division, it's just like sharing bigger numbers. We divide them one step at a time, just like with the cookies! 

Isn't sharing fun? That's how we do long division!
