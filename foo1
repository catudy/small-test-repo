To explain long division to a 4-year-old, we can think of it like sharing cookies with friends! 

Imagine you have some cookies and you want to share them equally. 

1. First, count how many cookies you have. Let's say you have 10 cookies.
2. Then, count how many friends you want to share them with. Let's say you have 2 friends.
3. Now, you want to see how many cookies each friend gets. 

Here's how we do it:
- Start with the 10 cookies and give 1 cookie to each friend, until you can't give anymore.
- You can give 1 cookie to each friend until you have none left. 

So each friend gets 5 cookies! 

That's just like long division! We are taking something big (10 cookies) and sharing it equally (5 cookies for each friend).

Isn't sharing fun? Now you know how to share cookies with your friends, just like doing long division! 

Letâ€™s practice sharing more cookies next time!
